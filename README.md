# git-utils

This is my attempt at recreating some tools that I had written and
worked on at my previous companies and side projects. Although
inspiration has been taken from what I remember of those tools I am
writing these from scratch in golang as an opportunity to learn
golang.

## Tools

- **`review`** - Creates pull requests with automatic branch naming, PR templates, and commit message updates
- **`keychain`** - Manages GitHub tokens securely in macOS keychain
- **`lint`** - Code linting and formatting tools
